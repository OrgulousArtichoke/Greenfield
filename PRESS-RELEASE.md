# Sumo Tomato #


## Sub-Heading ##
  > A multiplayer game you can play on with friends from your phone!

## Summary ##
  > Sumo Tomato is a multiplayer game that is designed to be played on a single large browser window. Users can connect to the same game instance from their mobile devices, which they will use as controllers for the game. The game is flexible and rounds cycle quickly, so that new players never have to wait too long to jump in.

## Problem ##
  > Local multiplayer gaming normally requires a console, controllers, and other hardware. This is inconvenient and not portable. Playing games at a party with your friends often requires excessive setup that detracts from the gaming experience.

## Solution ##
  > Sumo Tomato brings the "couch gaming with your buddies" experience anywhere by allowing users to run the game on any device with a web browser and control it from their mobile devices.
