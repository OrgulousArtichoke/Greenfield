{"name":"Sumo Tomato","tagline":"","body":"##Sumo Tomato\r\n\r\nSumo Tomato is a realtime multiplayer game we built using Node, express, Socketio, and the Phaser Javascript game library. We built this game to experiment with these technologies and craft a fun experience that people could share with their friends.\r\n\r\n## What you need\r\n\r\nYou'll need three things to play Sumo Tomato:\r\n\r\n1. A computer (main game screen)\r\n\r\n2. A phone\r\n\r\n3. Some friends!\r\n\r\nTo get started, just point the main display to [tinyurl.com/sumotomato](http://tinyurl.com/sumotomato) and then on your phones go to [http://tinyurl.com/sumocontroller](http://tinyurl.com/sumocontroller). \r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrgulousArtichoke/Greenfield/master/public/client/assets/screenshots/SumoStartScreen.PNG)\r\n\r\nTap the READY button and when everyone is ready to go your phones will automagically transform into Sumo controllers!\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrgulousArtichoke/Greenfield/master/public/client/assets/screenshots/IMG_0717.PNG)\r\n\r\n## How to Play\r\n\r\nThe premise of Sumo Tomato is decidedly high-concept: you're one of 4 Sumo Wrestlers who have given up the _Dohy≈ç_ and decided to throw tomatoes at each other. Jump, tomato-chuck, and wrestle your way to victory-- the last Sumo standing wins!\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrgulousArtichoke/Greenfield/master/public/client/assets/screenshots/SumoGameplay.PNG)\r\n\r\nTry not to get hit five times, or your controller will tell you:\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OrgulousArtichoke/Greenfield/0d37cf9965c00e9866f4246b8450593d6f643091/public/client/assets/screenshots/IMG_0714.PNG)\r\n\r\nWe hope you have as much fun playing it as we did building it!\r\n\r\n## Team\r\n  - __Product Owner__: John Wareing\r\n  - __Scrum Master__: Andrew Gonzales\r\n  - __Development Team Members__: Victor Algaze, Andrew Gonzales, John Wareing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
